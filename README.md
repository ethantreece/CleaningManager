A csc316 project where I implemented the learned data structures into an application. 

Cleaning Manager has now GUI and is run on the console. Two csv files are taken as input and the user can request a variety of different reports about the files. It can be further understood when looking at the test plan in the 'bbtp' folder and the sample input files in the 'input' folder.
